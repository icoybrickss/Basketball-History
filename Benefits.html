        <p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and one of the most widely viewed. It is a team sport that involves two teams of five active players each trying to score points against one another by throwing a ball through a 300 cm (10 feet) high hoop (the ‘basket’) under organised rules. It is played on both indoor and outdoor courts.
        <br><br>The size of the court, height of the basket, size of the basketball, and length of time that the game is played, can all vary according to the age, size and skill level of players. Basketball is a fast moving game that involves a lot of variety, including shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, defence and much more.

        <h2>Getting started with basketball</h2>
        <p>Although official games of basketball require 10 players, you can play a game of basketball with just one other person. You can also go out and shoot baskets by yourself. If you want to play basketball competitively, you can become a member of a team and get involved in local competition. Check out your local sports centres and associations for information on how to join a team, or start your own.</p>
        <h4>Basketball equipment</h4>
        <p>One of the great things about the game is that apart from having a basketball, you require very little other equipment to play. However, as basketball involves a lot of running and jumping, it can also be wise to have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>basketball or sports shoes that provide good ankle support</li>
            <li>mouth guards</li>
            <li>protective knee and elbow pads.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Basketball and children</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball is a great way for kids to get active and have fun. ‘Aussie hoops’ is a national introductory basketball program for primary school children, started by Basketball Australia and the Australian Sports Commission. It provides primary school girls and boys of all ages, abilities and skill levels, with the opportunity to play basketball and develop sport and social skills in a safe environment.
                <br><br>
            The program is delivered at local schools, community centers and local stadiums throughout Australia, by local associations and trained professionals. To find your local association, contact Basketball Victoria on (03) 9927 6666.

        <h2>Some general tips</h2>
        <h6>Suggestions include:</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Adults should check with their doctor before taking up basketball.</li>
            <li>Be aware that basketball is a fast-action game with lots of running, jumping, pivoting and twisting, so injuries and accidents can happen easily.</li>
            <li>Basketball puts a lot of stress on the legs, especially the knees and ankles, and puts pressure on tight shoulders.</li>
            <li>Protect yourself by becoming strong and flexible, as basketball is a very physically demanding game.</li>
            <li>Don’t overdo it (this will depend on your age and condition). Mix it up with other low-impact sports.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantage</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball, being a high-intensity sport, carries inherent risks of injuries such as sprains, fractures, and ligament damage. The abrupt stops, sharp turns, and physical contact during gameplay can lead to both short-term and long-term health issues for players. <br><br>
            Engaging in competitive basketball demands a significant time commitment. Players often face challenges balancing rigorous training schedules and frequent matches with other life priorities such as work, education, and family responsibilities. <br><br>
            Pursuing basketball at a competitive level can impose a substantial financial burden. Costs associated with quality equipment, travel expenses for tournaments, and participation fees can limit accessibility, making the sport less inclusive for individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. <br><br>
            The pressure to perform well in basketball, particularly in competitive environments, can lead to emotional stress. Players may experience anxiety, self-doubt, and the constant need to meet expectations, potentially impacting mental well-being both on and off the court. <br><br>
            Basketball facilities and organized leagues may not be readily available in all communities. Limited access to proper courts and infrastructure can hinder individuals from participating in the sport, restricting the potential benefits of physical activity and teamwork associated with basketball.
